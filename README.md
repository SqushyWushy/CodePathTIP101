# CodePath TIP101 Assignments

Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains all of my coding assignments and problem sets for CodePath's TIP101 course. **This is my first semester learning how to code**, so everything here reflects my journey as a beginner in programming. I'm excited to share my progress as I work through different concepts each week.

## About Me

Iâ€™m a first-time coder, learning the basics of programming through the CodePath TIP101 course. All of the code in this repository is beginner-level as Iâ€™m covering core programming concepts, mainly in Python. I'm learning a lot, and this repo is a record of my progress.

## What's Inside

The repository is organized into 10 weeks, each focusing on different concepts. I started the repository during **Week 3**, so Weeks 1 and 2 won't have any content.

### Folder Structure:

- **Week1**: (Empty)
- **Week2**: (Empty)
- **Week3**: Focuses on working with **strings and lists**.
- **Week4-10**: Upcoming weeks will dive deeper into different coding concepts as I continue my learning journey.

## Running the Assignments

To run any of the Python scripts:

1. Navigate to the specific week's folder.
2. Use Python 3.x to run the script from your terminal:

## Why This Repository?

Iâ€™m using this repository to document my learning process and track my progress over time. Since I started in Week 3, the content here will grow as I complete more assignments and projects.

Feel free to explore my code! Itâ€™s all beginner-level, but Iâ€™m proud of how far Iâ€™ve come and excited about whatâ€™s next. ðŸ˜Š
